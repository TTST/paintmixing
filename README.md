#PaintMixing Assistant

Paint Mixing Assistant is an intelligent paint mixing tool designed for paint color blending, suitable for miniature painting, artistic creation, and interior design. Whether you need to mix a specific paint color or simulate the blending of different pigments, this app helps you calculate precise formulas, reduce trial and error, and improve efficiency!

Features:
* A virtual paint mixing tool that generates formulas based on existing pigments, helping users mix their target colors.
* Recipe calculation: Input the desired color, and the app will compute the optimal mixing formula.
* Pigment database: Preloaded with measured data for Kimera paints and supports user selection and adjustment of mixing ratios.
* Color matching: Pick colors from a palette to find the closest pigment combination.
* Light simulation: Calculates final mixed colors under standard illumination (D65) for accurate color representation.

Core Technology:
* Utilizes the Kubelka-Munk theory to calculate the optical reflectance of mixed pigments, ensuring accurate color prediction.
* Implements numerical optimization algorithms (Scipy optimizer) to determine the best pigment ratios.
* Uses sRGB and XYZ color spaces to ensure visually accurate color matching.

Who Is It For?
* Painters & Interior Designers – Precisely match wall colors and create custom paint blends.
* Miniature & Model Painting Enthusiasts – Replicate tutorial colors and reduce pigment waste.
* Artists & Painters – Create unique colors and optimize pigment mixing.
* Color Science Researchers – Study the optical properties of paint and pigment blending.
